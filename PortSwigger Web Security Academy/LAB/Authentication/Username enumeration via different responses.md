# Username enumeration via different responses
* This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable usernmae and password, which can be found in the provided wordlists.
	* To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.
	
### 1. Capture the request for log in to brute force
* The request `POST /login` is captured. Send it to Intruder to use Burp Intruder.
	* Use the Sniper attack to find a vliad username. Set the payload position to the username.

* Put the username list to the payload.

* Then, Start the attack.
	* As a result, a request with a different response length is found. It means that the payload `announce` is a valid username.

### 2. Use the same request to brute force the password
* Change the value of the username to `announce`, which the previous attack just found, and set the payload potision to the password. Then, load the password list, and start attack to find the valid password.

* From the result, only one payload returns a 302 response. Which means that the payload is the valid password.

* With obtained credentials, log in is granted. The lab is solved.
