# Username enumeration via subtly different responses
* This lab is subtly vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predicatable username and password, which can be found in the following wordlists:
	* To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.

### 1. Capture the request when log in to enumerate username
* When enter an invalid credentials, a message `Invalid username or password.` is given

* Send the request to Burp Intruder and set the payload position to "username".

* Set the payload with the possible user list which is provided.

* Set the Grep - Match at the `Options => Grpe-Match`
	* Add `Invalid username or password.`

* From the result, only one request has a subtly different response.
	* the payload `apollo` has a message `Invalid username or password` without a dot(.)

### 2. Set the payload for the password brute force
* Change username to `apollo`, set the payload position to the password, and load the password list. Then, start the attack.
	* As a result, only one payload have a status code 302. It means that the payload is the valid password.

* With obtained credentials, access to the apollo's account is granted. The lab is sovled.
