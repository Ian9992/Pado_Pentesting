# 2FA simple bypass
* This lab's two factor authentication can be bypassed. You have already obtained a valid username and password, but do not have access to the user's 2FA verification code.
	* To solve this lab, access Carlos's account page.
	* Your credentials: `wiener:peter`
	* Victim's credentials: `carlos:montoya`
### 1. Enumerate the functionality using `wiener` account
* When log in to the page, a 2FA code is sent to the email client.

* Enter the code in to the panel. (`POST /login2`)

* When the code is entered, the page is redirected to `/my-account`
### 2. Bypass the 2FA
* When log in as the victim user, modify the URL to bypass the `/login2` to avoid to enter 4 digit code.
	* As a result, the attacker can log in as Carlos account without 2FA. The lab is solved.
