# Remote code execution via web shell upload
* This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It doesn't perform any validation on the file users upload before storing them on the server's file system
	* To solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file `/home/carlos/secret`. Submit this secret using the button provied in the lab banner.
	* You can log in to your own account using the following credentials `wiener:peter`

### 1. Make a PHP payload to exfiltrate the target file
* the exploit is named "file.php"
```php
<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
```
### 2. Uplaod the file on the web server
* Log in as _wiener_. At the "My account" page, a file upload function is found
