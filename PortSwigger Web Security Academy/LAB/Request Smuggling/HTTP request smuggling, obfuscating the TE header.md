# HTTP request smuggling, obfuscating the TE header
* This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the two servers handle duplicate HTTP request headers in different ways. The front-end server rejects requests that aren't using the GET or POST method.
	* To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server, so that the next request processed by the back-end server appears to use the medhot _GPOST_.
### 1. Capture the request and modify the request
