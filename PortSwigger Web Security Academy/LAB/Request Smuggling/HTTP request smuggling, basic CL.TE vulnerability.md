# HTTP request smuggling, basic CL.TE vulnerability
* THis lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. The front-end server rejects requests that aren't using the GET or POST method.
	* To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server, so that the next request processed by the back-end server appears to use the method _GPOST_

### 1. Capture the reuqest

* Change the request method

### 2. Inject `Transfer-Encoding`
* Since the POST request has `Content-Length:0`, inject `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` to exploit.
	* Send the request twice.

* 1st response.

* 2nd response.

* It processes the first chunk, which is stated to be zero length, and so is treated as terminating the request. The following bytes, _G_, is left unprocessed, adn the back-end server will treat theses as being the start of the next reqeust in the sequence.
	* That is why the response is looking for "GPOST".

* The lab is solved.
