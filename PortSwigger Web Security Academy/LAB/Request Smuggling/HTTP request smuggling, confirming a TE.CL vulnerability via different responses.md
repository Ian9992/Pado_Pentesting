# HTTP request smuggling, confirming a TE.CL vulnerability via differential responses
* This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the back-end server doesn't support chunked encoding.
	* To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-edn server, so that a subsequent request for / (the web root) trigger a 404 NOT found response.
