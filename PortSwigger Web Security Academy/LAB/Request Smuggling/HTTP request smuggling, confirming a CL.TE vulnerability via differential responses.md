# HTTP requst smuggling, confirming a CL.TE vulnerability via differntial responses
* This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding.
	* To solve the lab, smuggle a request to the back-end server, so that a subsequent request for `/` triggers a 404 Not found response.

### 1. Use the Burp HTTP Request smuggler
* From the result, a possiblly vulnerable request is found

### 2. Modify the request to get a 404 status code
* when the request is sent twice, the 404 status code is given.
