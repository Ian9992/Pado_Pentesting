# Blind OS command injection with time delays
* This lab contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function. The application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied detials. The output from the command is not returned in the response.
 * To solve the lab, exploit the blind OS command injection vulnerability to cause a 10 second delay.

### 1. Identify the vulnerable point
* Capture a request of a feedback function to see if there has a vulnerability.

### 2. Injection an OS command after a value of a parameter in between `|| ||`
* Use a ping command to cause a 10 second delay.

* As a result, the target got a 10 seconds delay and the lab is solved.
