## Combining web cache poisoning vulnerabilities
* This lab is susceptible to web cache poisonin, but only if you construct a complex exploit chain.
	* A user visits the home page roughly once a minute and their language is set to English. To solve the lab, poison the cache with a response that executes `alert(document.cookie)` in the visitor's browser.

### 1. Run Param miner to identify some headers for exploit
* Capture a request and identify the headers.
	* From the result, `X-Forwarded-Host` and `X-Origin-URL` headers are found.

### 2. Insert _X-Forwarded-Host_ and enumerate the response
* use `X-Forwarded-Host: test.com` as the value of the header.
