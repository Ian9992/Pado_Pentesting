# Web cache poisoning with unkeyed cookie
* This lab is vulnerable to web cache poisoning because cookies are not included in the cache key. A user visits the home page roughly once a minute. To solve this lab, poison the cache with a response that executes a `alert(1)` in the visitor's browser.

### 1. Capture a request for enumeration
* This request contains a cookie `fehost=prod-cache-01`

### 2. Try to modify the cookie value and enumerate the response
* Change the value to `teststring`

### 3. Inject a XSS payload into Cookie value
* Try to injet `"-alert(1)-"` after a string.

* As a result, the `X-Cache` gives a vlaue `hit`. Therefore, the cache is poisoned
	* Wait until the victim visit the site. As a result, the lab is solved.
