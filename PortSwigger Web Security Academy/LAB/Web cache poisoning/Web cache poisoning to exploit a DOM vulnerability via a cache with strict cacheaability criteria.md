# Web cache poisoning to exploit a DOM vulnerability via a cache with stric cacheability criteria
* This lab ontains a DOM-based vulnerability that can be exploited as part of a web cache poisoning attack. A user visits the home page roughly once a minute. Note that the cache used by this lab has stricter criteria for deciding which responses are cacheable, so you will need to study the cache behavior closely.
	* To solve the lab, poison the cache with a response that executes `alert(document.cookie)` in the visitor's browser.
### 1. Identify some headers to use for the exploit
* Using Param Miner to identify the headers to use for the exploit.
