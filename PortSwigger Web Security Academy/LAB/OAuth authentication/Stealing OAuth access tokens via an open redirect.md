# Stealing OAuth access tokens via an open redirect
* This lab uses an OAuth service to allow users to log in with their social media account. Flawed validation by the OAuth service makes it possible for an attacker to leak acces token to arbitrary pages on the client application.
	* To solve the lab, identify an open redirect on the blog website and use this to steal an access toekn for the admin user's account. Use the access token to obtain the admin's API key and submit the solution using the button provided in the lab banner.
	* The admin user will open anything you send from the exploit server and they always have an active session with the OAuth service.
	* You can log in via your won social media account using the following credentials: `wiener: peter`
