# Authentication bypass via OAuth implicit flow
* This lab uses an OAuth service to allow users to log in with their social media account. Flawed validation by the client application makes it possible for an attacker to log in to other user's accounts without knowing their password.
	* To solve the lab, log in to Carlos's account. His email address is `carlos@carlos-montoya.net`.
	* You can log in with your own social media account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

### 1. Capture the request when log in as `wiener` using OAuth
* When click "My page", a social login panel is found.
