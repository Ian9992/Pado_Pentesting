# File path traversal, traveral sequences blocked with absolute path bypass
* This lab contains a file path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images.
* The application blocks traversal sequnces but treats the supplied filename as being relative to a default working directory.
	* To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the `/etc/passwd` file.

### 1. Find the vulnerable point for the directory traversal
* From an image from a post, a possible vulnerable parameter `filename` is found.

* Capture the request and send it to the repeater.
	* Try some path traversal sequnces. However, it does not work.

### 2. Try to retrieve the target file using an absolute file path
* Use the absolute file path of the file to retrieve the target file.
```http
?filename=/etc/passwd
```
* As a result, the content of the target file is retrieved.

* As a result, the lab is solved.
