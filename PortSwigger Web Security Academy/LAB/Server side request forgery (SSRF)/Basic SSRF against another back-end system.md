# Basic SSRF against another back-end system
* This lab has a stock feature which fetches data from an internal system.
	* To solve the lab, use the stock check functionality to scan the internal _192.168.0.x_ range for an admin interface on port 8080, then use it to delete the user _carlos_.

### 1. Send the _POST /product/stock_ request to intruder
* It can be obtained when click "Check stock" on a product page.

### 2. Set the payload position and payloads 
* Set the value of _stockApi_ parameter to `http://192.168.0.1:8080/admin`, Set the payload position to "1" and URL encode.
