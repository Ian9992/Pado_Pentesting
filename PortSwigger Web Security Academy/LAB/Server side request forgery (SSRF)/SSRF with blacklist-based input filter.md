# SSRF with blacklist-based input filter
* This lab has a stock feature which fetches data from an internal system.
	* To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at _http://localhost/admin_ and delete the user _carlos_
	* The developers has deployed two weak anti-SSRF defenses that you will need to bypass.
### 1. Capture the _POST /product/stock_ request

* Then, send the request to repeater to modify

### 2. Access the `/admin` using case variation to evade the blacklist-based input filter
