# SQL injection UNION attack, finding a column containing text
* This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other talbes.
	* To construct such an attack, you first need to determine the number of columns returned by the query. 
	* The next step is to identify a column that is compatible with string data.
* This lab will provide a random value that you need to make appear within the query results. To solve the lab, perform SQL injection UNION attack that returns an additional row containing the value provided. This technique helps you determine which columns are compativle with string data.

### 1. Find the corresponding column number
* When enter three NULLs on the UNION attack, 200 status code is given. Which means the right column number is three.
```sql
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--
```

### 2. Find a column that is compatible with string data
* Test all columns to find a string compatible column
```bash
' UNION SELECT 'test',NULL,NULL--
.
.
` UNION SELCT NULL,NULL,'test'--
```
 * When enter string data into the second column, 200 staus code is given. It means that the second column is string compatable.
	* Replace the string data to `KoUuoC` to solve the lab. As a result, the lab is solved.
