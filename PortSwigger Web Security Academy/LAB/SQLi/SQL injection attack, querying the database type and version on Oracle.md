# SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle
* This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. You can use a UNION attack to retrieve the results from an injected query.
	* To solve the lab, display the database version string.

### 1. Determine the corresponding number of columns
* Testing for two columns returns 200 status code. It means that there has two columns.
```sql
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--
```

### 2. Determine string compatible columns
* However, both columns retunrs 500 status  code. It might not compatible to any of the columns or different Database.

### 3. Find the version number
* To determine which database is used, find ther version number.
	* Test all the database type using the [Portswigger SQLi cheat sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet)
* For the testing for Oracle database, the version number is revealed.
```sql
' UNION SELECT NULL, BANNER FROM v$version--
```
