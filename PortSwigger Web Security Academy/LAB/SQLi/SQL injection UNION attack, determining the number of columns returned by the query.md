# SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query
* This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.
	* The first step of such an attack is to determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query.
	* You will then use this technique in subsequent labs to construct the full attack.
* To solve the lab, determine the number of columns returned by the query by performing an SQL injection UNION attack that returns an additional row containing null values.
### 1. Determine the number of columns
* Capturet request of the category filter to find the number of columns using code below
	* Add additional NULL until the number of columns is found. 
```bash
1' UNION SELECT NULL--
.
.
1' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--
```
* When enter three NULLs, the response gives 200 status code back (500 status code for incorrect column numbers). It means there has three columns on the query.

* As a result, the lab is solved.
