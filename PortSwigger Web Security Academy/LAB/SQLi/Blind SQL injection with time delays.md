# Blind SQL injection with time delays
* THis lab contains a blidn SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs an SQL query contatining the value of the submitted cookie.
* The results of the SQL query are note returned, and the application does not respond any differently based on whether the query returns any rows or causes an error. However, since the query is executed synchronously, it is possible to tirgger conditional time delays to infer information.
	* To solve thelab, exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to cause a 10 second delay.

### 1. Put a time delay attack from the [Cheat sheet](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet)

```sql
' || pg_sleep(10) --
```
* As a result, the response back after 10 seconds. The lab is solved.
