# SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving multiple values in a single column
* This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results for the query aer returned in the application's response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.
* The database contains a different table called `users` ,a with columns called `username` and `password`.
	* To solve the lab, perfor an SQL inejection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the `administrator` user.
### 1. Determine the corresponding number of columns
* When testing for two columns, 200 status code is given. It means there has two columns.
```sql
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--
```

### 2. Find string data compatible columns
* From the testing, only second column is compatible to string data (Returns 200 status code)
```sql
` UNION SELECT NULL,'test'--
```
