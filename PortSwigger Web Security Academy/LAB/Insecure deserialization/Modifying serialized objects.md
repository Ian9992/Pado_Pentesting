# Modifying serialized objects
* The lab uses a serialization-based session mechanism and is vulnerable to privilege esclation as a result. To solve the lab, edit the serialized object in the session cookie to exploit this vulnerability and gain administrative privileges. Then, delete Carlos's account.
	* You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: `wiener:peter`

### 1. Enumerate request of `GET /my-account`
* Login as "wiener" and send the request to repeater for enumeration

* Use the Burp Inspector to decode the cookie

* It looks like a PHP serialization format.
### 2. Modify the cookie using the inspector
* Change the boolean value of `admin` from 0 to 1. Then, click the "Apply changes" button to apply, and send the request.
