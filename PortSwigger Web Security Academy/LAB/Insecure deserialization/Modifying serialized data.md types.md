# Modifying serialized data types
* This lab uses a serialization-based session mechanism and is vulnerable to authentication bypass as a result. To solve the lab, edit the serialized object in the session cookie to access the `administrator` account. Then, delete Carlos.
	* You can log in to your own account using the following credentials `wiener:peter`
### 1. Enumerate `GET /my-account` request to enumerate cookie
* Then, send it to repeater for enumeration
	* Use the Burp Inspector for decoding.

* It looks a PHP serialization format.
### 2. Modify the values using Burp inspector
* Modify some values to login as "administrator"
	* `s:6:"wiener";` to `s:13:"administrator";`
	* `s:32:"siiannrnf47yp7fl3dc8pewrtjzcgnkc";` to `i:0;`
