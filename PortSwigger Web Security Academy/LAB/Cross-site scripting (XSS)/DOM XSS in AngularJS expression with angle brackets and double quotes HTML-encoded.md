# DOM XSS in AngularJS expression with angle brackets and double quotes HTML-encoded
* This lab contains a DOM-based XXS vulnerability in a AngularJS expression within the search functionality.
  * AngularJS is a popular JavaScript library, which scans the contents of HTML nodes containing the _ng-app_ attribute (also know as an AngularJS directive). When a directive is added to the HTML code, you cna execute JavaScript expressions within double curly braces, this technique is usful when angle brackets are being encoded.
    * To solve this lab, perform a XXS attack that executes an AngularJS expression and calls the `alert` function.
### 1. Enter a randome value into the search box and analyze using the inspector
* Enter a random value into the search box.

### 2. Find the inserted value using the inspector
* It is enclosed in an `ng-app` directive

### 3. Inject an AngularJS expression to trigger an alert into the search box
```javascript
{{$on.constructor('alert(1)')()}}
```
* When, click the search, an alert is popped up
