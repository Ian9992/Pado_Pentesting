# Reflected XSS in canonical link tag
* This lab reflects user input in a canonical link tag and escape angle brackets.
	* To solve the lab, perform a XSS attack on the home page that injects an attribute that calls the _alert_ function.
	* To assist with your exploit, you can assume that the simulated user will press the following key combinations:
		* ALT+SHIFT+X
		* CTRL+ALT+X
		* ALT+x
* Use Chrome to solve the lab

### 1. Visit the following URL
```http
https://ac211f011f87fb1ec05e15eb00640053.web-security-academy.net/?%27accesskey=%27x%27onclick=%27alert(1)
```
* This sets the _x_ key as an access key for the whole page, When a user presses the access key, the _alert_ function is called.
### 2. To trigger the exploit on yourself, press one of the following key combinations:
* **WINDOWS**: ALT+SHIFT+x
* **MACOS**: CTRL+ALT+X
* **LINUX**: ALT+X

* When I press the key combination, the _alert_ function is called
	* the lab is solved
