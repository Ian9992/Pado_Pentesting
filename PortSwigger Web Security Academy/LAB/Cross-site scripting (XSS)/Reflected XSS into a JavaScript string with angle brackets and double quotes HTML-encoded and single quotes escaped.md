# Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with angle brackets and double quotes HTML-encoded and single quotes escaped
* This lab contains a reflected XSS vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality where angle brackets and double are HTML encoded and single quotes are escaped.
	* To solve this lab, perform a XSS attack that breaks out of the JavaScript string and calls the _alert_ function.
### 1. Try sending the payload `test\payload`
* It returns `test\\payload`, it means that the backslash doesn't get escaped.

### 2. Send a payload to break out of the JavaScript string and inject an alert
* Since the backslash does not get escaped, use this payload to brake out of the JavaScript string and inject an alert.
```javascript
\';alert(document.domain)//
```
* As a result, an alert is popped up and the lab is solved.
