# DOM XSS in jQuery selector sink using a hashchange event
* This lab contains a DOM-based XSS vulnerability on the home page. It uses jQuery's `$ ()` selector function to auto-scroll to a given post, whose title is passed via a `locationl.hash` property.
	* To solve the lab, deliver an exploit to the victim taht calls the `print()` function in their browser.

### 1. Use the web inspector to find jQuery's `$ ()` selector function

* From the result, it uses a `location.hash`

### 2. At the Exploit server, make an exploit
* At the Body section, use a malicious `iframe` exploit
```javascript
<iframe src="https://ac3f1f9c1fcc48b1c078d9ab00540089.web-security-academy.net/#" onload="this.src+='<img src=x onerror=print()>'"></iframe>
```
* Store the exploit, and click "View exploit" to confirm that the `print()` function is called.

* It works.

### 3. Deliver the exploit to victim
* When click the "Deliver the exploit to victim" to send the exploit, the lab is solved
