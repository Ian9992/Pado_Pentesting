# Reflected XSS into a template literal with angle brackets, single, double quotes, backslash and backticks Unicode-escaped
* This lab contains a reflected XSS vulnerability in the search blog functionality. The reflection occurs inside a template string with angle brackets, single, and double quotes HTML encoded, and backticks escaped.
  * To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the _alert_ function inside the template string.

### 1. Test a payload to execute JavaScript inside the template string
```html
${alert(1)}
```
* As a result, an alert is triggered. The lab is solved
