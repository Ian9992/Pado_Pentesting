# Reflected XSS with event handlers and _href_ attributes blocked
* This lab contains a reflected XSS vulnerability with some whitelisted tags, but all events and anchor _href_ attributes are blocked.
	* To solve the lab, perform a XSS attack taht injects a vector that, when clicked, calls the _alert_ function
	* Not that you need to label your vector with the word "Click" in order to induce the simulated lab user to click your vector. For example:
	```html
	<a href="">Click me</a>
	```
