# DOM XSS in `innerHTML` sink using source `location.search`
* This lab contains a DOM-based XSS vulnerability in the search blog functionality. It uses an _innerHTML_ assginment, which changes the HTML contents of a _div_ element, using data from `location.search`
  * To solve the lab, perfrom a XXS attack that calls the _alert_ function.

### 1. Test to put a random data into the search panel

### 2. Analyze the result using a browser's inspector
* Search for the entered string

### 3. Inject a XSS payload
```html
<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
```
* As a result, an alert is popped up.

* It can be analyzed by the inspector

* In this case, the `src` attribute is invalid and throws an error. This triggers the `onerror` event handler, which then calls the `alert()`
  * As a result, the payload is executed whenever the user's browser attempts to load the page containing this malicious post.

* The lab is solved
