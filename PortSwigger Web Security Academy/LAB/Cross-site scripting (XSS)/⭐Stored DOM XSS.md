# Stored DOM XSS
* This lab demonstrate a stored DOM vulnerability in the blog comment functionality. To solve this lab, exploit this vulnerability to call the `alert()` function.

### 1. Post a comment containing the following vector
```html
<><img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
```
* In an attempt to prevnet XSS, the website uses the JavaScript `replace()` function to encode angle brackets. However, when the first argument is a string, the function only replace the firest occurrence.
	* We exploit this vulnerability by simply including an extra set of angle brackets at the begginning og the comment. These angle brackets will be encoded, but any subsequent angle brackets will be unaffected, enabling us to effectively bypass the filter and inject HTML
	
* When go back to the post, an alert is popped up and the lab is solved
