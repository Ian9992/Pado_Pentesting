# CSRF where token is not tied to user session
* This lab;s email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF, it uses token to try to prevent CSRF attacks, but they aren't interated into the site's session handling system.
	* To solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attck to change the viewer's email address.
	* You have two accounts on the application that you cna use to help design your attack. The credentials are as followes: `wiener:peter`, `carlos:montoya`

### 1. On the Burp web browser, intercept the request when _Wiener_ Update the email

### 2. On the Firefox web browser, intercpet the request when _carlos_ update the email
* Then, send the request to repeater and swap the CSRF token with _wiener's_ CSRF token
	* When the modified request is sent, the 302 response is given and the _carlos's_ email is successfully updated.
