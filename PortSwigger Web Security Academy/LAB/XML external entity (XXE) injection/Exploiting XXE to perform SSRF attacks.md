# Exploiting XXE to perform SSRF attacks
* This lab has a "Check Stock" feature that parses XML input and returns any unexpected values in the response.
	* The lab server is running a (simulated) EC2 metadata endpoint at the default URL, which is `http://169.254.168.254/`. This endpoint can be used to retrieve data about the instance, some of which might be sensitive.
	* To solve the lab, exploit XXE vulnerability to perform an SSRF attack that obtains the server's IAM secret access key from the EC2 metadata endpoint.
